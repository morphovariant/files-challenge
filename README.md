# INFO 343 SU15 Yoakum

# Hello. 

# I'm realizing just now that I did not add a description to my repository when I created it, so I added one here and added a description in GitHub. I'm very curious to see the changes merge, if that's in fact what happens. 

# In other news, I'm very excited about this class. I'm going to be able to use the skills I learn immediately, as I already have a FT informatics job, working for a biotech company, and I've been there 15 years.
