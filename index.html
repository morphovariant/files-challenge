		<p id="bio">
			Sherlock Holmes is the creation of Arthur Conan Doyle, initially a consulting detective in late 19th century novels and short stories, but now the "most portrayed literary human character in film [and] TV," according to <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/5/sherlock-holmes-awarded-title-for-most-portrayed-literary-human-character-in-film-tv-41743/" target=_blank>Guiness World Records</a>. He is perhaps known best for his accute use of observation and logic to solve crimes, for his biographer and partner, Dr. John H. Watson, and for the devotion he has inspired in fans consistently since his introduction. It seems every generation has a Holmes of their own.
